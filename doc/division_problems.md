# Division Problems
deal with the allocation of resources to agents, such as desk
space in a shared office or charging time reserved for a particular EV. Formally,
they can be characterized by a partitioning of decision variables (Xa ⊆ X) a∈A such
that the utility of agent a only depends on the values assigned to the variables in
Xa – without externalities. For example, given the same reserved desk slots, an
employee is indifferent to the assignments of the other desks. Solution concepts
include constraints for envy-freeness or proportionality. (Google proposal)
